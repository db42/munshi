## Typescript guidance:
- avoid using 'any'
- avoid mutating an argument within function
- avoid passing by reference
- ALWAYS uses import type foo from 'bar' or import { type foo } from 'bar' when importing types.
- Use optional property over nullable property. See examples:
- don't modify any component to match the test result!

Optional property (date?: Date)

Nullable property (date: Date | null)

## Making changes
- Use more tools e.g. command line tools
- for any type errors, make sure to read the whole type before attempting the fix
- for any change in server/, run `npm run build` to verify any tsc errors
- If following a todo file for a task, Pick 1 step at a time. complet it. let me review it. once i say okay, then you can update the todo file first and move to the next step. follow this always
