# Product guidelines
## Data viewer

Viewer for parsedDocumentData for each document is extremely critical for this application.

Out BE will parse all the documents (pdfs/csv etc.). A good viewer for this data will help an expert admin of this app to review and verify this parsed data. Therefore, viewer should be - for power users 
- show high density information
- show all the information present (don't skip anything)
- show information in the right formats e.g. use tables etc.
- minimize number of clicks it takes - ideally user should be able to just scroll and verify the information
- avoid doing any computations on client side. since goal is to verify backend data, if you do any computation client side, it defeats the purpose.
