## Plan for Implementing Document Fetching in DocumentsPortal

1. **Create a GET endpoint in the server**:
   - We need to add a GET endpoint to the documents.ts routes file to fetch all documents for a user
   - The endpoint will use the existing `getDocumentsByUser` service function

2. **Create an API service in the client**:
   - Create a new directory `client/src/api` with a file `documents.ts` to handle document-related API calls
   - Implement a function to fetch documents from the server

3. **Update the DocumentsPortal component**:
   - Add state for loading and error handling
   - Use React's useEffect to fetch documents when the component mounts
   - Replace the hardcoded documents array with the fetched data
   - Add proper error handling and loading states

4. **Enhance the UI**:
   - Add loading indicators
   - Add error messages if fetching fails
   - Ensure the UI handles empty document lists gracefully

Here's a more detailed breakdown of each step:

### 1. Server-side: Add GET endpoint

We need to add a GET endpoint to the `documents.ts` routes file that will:
- Accept a userId parameter
- Use the existing `getDocumentsByUser` service function
- Return the list of documents in JSON format

### 2. Client-side: Create API service

We'll create a new API service that will:
- Use fetch or axios to make HTTP requests
- Include a function to get all documents for a user
- Handle errors and response parsing

### 3. Client-side: Update DocumentsPortal component

We'll update the DocumentsPortal component to:
- Add state variables for documents, loading state, and errors
- Use useEffect to fetch documents when the component mounts
- Replace the hardcoded documents array with the fetched data
- Add conditional rendering for loading and error states

### 4. Client-side: Enhance the UI

We'll enhance the UI to:
- Show a loading spinner while fetching documents
- Display error messages if fetching fails
- Show a message if no documents are found
- Ensure the document list renders correctly with the fetched data

This plan provides a clear path to implementing the document fetching functionality in the DocumentsPortal component. Once this is implemented, we can move on to creating a dedicated page for each document.

Would you like me to proceed with implementing any specific part of this plan, or would you like to discuss or modify the approach?
